This repository contains three separate data-focused projects completed during university coursework. Each project uses different tools and methodologies, including Jupyter Notebook, Power BI, and SAS Enterprise Guide. The projects are grouped by technology for clarity and easy navigation.

1. Data Processing Project (Jupyter Notebook)

A Jupyter-based data analysis workflow focusing on dataset exploration, preprocessing, and structured investigation.
The project includes:

- Dataset exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Calculations and feature analysis
- Notebook files and raw data

2. Power BI Project – Global Music Streaming Insights

An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing global music streaming listener preferences.
The project includes:

- Dataset imports and transformations
- Visualizations of listening habits and trends
- A full interactive report file (.pbix)

3. SAS Enterprise Guide Project
